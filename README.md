# SQL Essentials

Welcome to **SQL Essentials**! 🚀

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and practice ground for SQL. I am on a journey to master SQL, and I will be adding new concepts, queries, and examples every day.

## 🎯 Goal
My goal is to build a comprehensive reference for SQL, covering everything from the basics to advanced topics.

## 📚 Concepts Covered So Far
The repository is organized by concepts. Here are some of the topics currently included:

- **Filtering Rows**: Examples of `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, and other operators to filter data.
- **Data Manipulation**: `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statements.

## 🛠 Usage
Each `.sql` file contains example queries. You can run these against your database to see how they work.

## 📅 Daily Updates
I am committed to adding more concepts daily. Stay tuned for updates!
